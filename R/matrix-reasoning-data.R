#' @section Answer coding:
#' The subjects answered a set of assessment items seeking to determine
#' their matrix reasoning abilities. Subjects that answered with a value between
#' 0 to 7 were marked as incorrect. Subjects who answered a question with 10
#' selected the correct answer and, thus, were marked as correct.

#' @section Notes:
#'
#' From the OpenPsychometrics' code book that accompanied the data, they noted:
#'
#' 1. The possible answers were presented in two rows of four with
#'    a random order for each participant.
#' 2. The collection of this data was of mediocre quality.
