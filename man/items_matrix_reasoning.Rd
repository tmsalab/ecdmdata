\section{Answer coding}{

The subjects answered a set of assessment items seeking to determine
their matrix reasoning abilities. Subjects that answered with a value between
0 to 7 were marked as incorrect. Subjects who answered a question with 10
selected the correct answer and, thus, were marked as correct.
}

\section{Notes}{


From the OpenPsychometrics' code book that accompanied the data, they noted:
\enumerate{
\item The possible answers were presented in two rows of four with
a random order for each participant.
\item The collection of this data was of mediocre quality.
