\section{Data pre-processing}{

We have applied list-wise deletion during pre-processing to remove any
observations with missing values from the data set.
}

\section{Answer coding}{

The subjects answered a set of assessment items seeking to determine
the level of anxiety. Answers given in \strong{bold} represent the desired
response. If a subject matched this response, they were given a 1 inside
of the item matrix, otherwise they received a zero.
